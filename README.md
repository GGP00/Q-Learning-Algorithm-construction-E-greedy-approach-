# Generic Q Learning case implementation
Python 3.6 implementation of how to build and apply the Q-Learning algorithm with E-greedy approach to escape from a 2D maze with static fire and obstacles. All this can be extrapolated to several cases in which the environment could be represented as a grid of strings with spatial sense, such as mazes, etc.
