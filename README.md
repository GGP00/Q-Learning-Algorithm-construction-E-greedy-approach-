# Generic script: Q-Learning general case implementation
Python >3.0 Q-Learning (E-greedy approach) algorithm (Reinforcement Learning) for any generic implementation in which the environment could be represented as a grid of strings (_E_greedy_Q_Learning_general_application_).


# Practical application: Q-Learning fire evacuation from maze example
How to apply the Q-Learning to escape from a maze with fire and obstacles. The maze is a 2D list which simulates a grided floor. The learning time, for a 20x20 size and a range of 8 actions (directions), is approximately 4 minutes thanks to the hashed searching. It can be found in self explicative jupyter notebook format (_QLearning_fire_maze_escaping_example.ipynb_) and in script format (_QLearning_fire_maze_escaping_example.py_).
