# Jupyter Notebook: Q-Learning fire evacuation from maze example
file> _QLearning_fire_maze_escaping_example.ipynb_ :
Python >3.0 code practical example in self explicative jupyter notebook format of how to build and apply the Q-Learning (e-greedy) algorithm (Reinforcement Learning) to escape from a maze with fire and obstacles. The maze is a 2D list which simulates a grided floor. The learning time, for a 20x20 size and a range of 8 actions (directions), is approximately 4 minutes thanks to the hashed searching.
